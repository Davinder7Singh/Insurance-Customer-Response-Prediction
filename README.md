 #Project Overview
  Developed a robust machine learning solution to predict customer responses to insurance policy offers, leveraging a dataset of over 380,000 customer records
  Trained and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), selecting Random Forest for its highest accuracy (86%) and ROC-AUC score (0.93)
  Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights, such as: Gender and age group trends in insurance purchases
  Impact of vehicle age and damage on purchase likelihood Identification of uninsured customers as a prime target segment
  Deployed the final model as an interactive Streamlit web application, integrating Groq’s LLaMA 3 generative AI to provide personalized suggestions for customers unlikely to purchase, 
  enhancing user engagement and conversion strategies.



 #Key Features
  Predict customer interest in insurance.
  Power BI dashboard to explore customer trends.
  LLaMA 3 for personalized suggestions when prediction = "No".
  Deployed as an interactive Streamlit app.
