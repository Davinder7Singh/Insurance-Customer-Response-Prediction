##  Project Overview

- Developed a robust machine learning solution to predict customer responses to insurance policy offers, leveraging a dataset of over 380,000 records.
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - **Random Forest** ✅ *(Best: 86% Accuracy, 0.93 ROC-AUC)*
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights:
  - Gender and age group trends in insurance purchases
  - Impact of vehicle age and damage on purchase likelihood
  - Identification of uninsured customers as a prime target segment
- Deployed the final model as an interactive **Streamlit web application**
- Integrated **Groq’s LLaMA 3 (Generative AI)** to provide personalized suggestions for users unlikely to purchase, enhancing engagement and conversion strategies.
